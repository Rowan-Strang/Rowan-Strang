At Dev Accademy I lead a team to create 'Hot Coffee' a mobile first website to crowd source coffee ratings and help people find their nearest and best cup of coffee.

[Check out the deployed version here](https://hotcoffee.devacademy.nz) (unfortunately it only features Wellington cafes)

I'm currently working on 'Day Builder' a site for wedding videogarphers and photographers to quickly create a timeline for the day and add it to their own calendar
the magic here is that day builder will forcast and account for the driving time between each new location, giving users and their clients an accurate understanding of how precious time will be spent

I'm currenty building out my portfolio and about to start learning Swift and Swift UI

I'm passionate about all forms of technology & software
But in particular I love:
- iOS
- MacOS
- Shortcuts
- AI
- Web Automation
- Home Automation


My journey into code started with the iOS Workflow app and later the iOS Shortcuts app, within this space I came to discover API's, Databases and UX design.
